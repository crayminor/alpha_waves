EEG data, reading my own alpha waves

Neurobiology Laboratory (BIPN 145) - Dr. Juavinett

Code template for EEG analysis provided in class, adapdted slightly for specific use. 2-lead electrode setup, ground and 
electrode in frontal, second electrode auditory area. Looking for differences in alpha wave intensity with no music (eyes closed), 
and varying BPM classical music. Figures at bottom of notebook feature Power Spectral Density across conditions, and example spectogram.
